    <h2>Keynote: The Officer's Role in Retention & Renewal (0:10–0:25)</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Picture a club meeting where every seat is filled, members are laughing, and new faces keep coming back. That's what happened in my club when we focused on retention. But it wasn't magic—it was leadership. As officers, you hold the key to keeping members engaged and your club thriving.</p>
    
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I'm here to inspire you to see your role as a retention superpower. You'll learn three strategies to keep members coming back and renew your club's energy.</p>
    
    <h3>Supporting Points</h3>
    <p>1. <strong>Create a Welcoming Culture</strong><br>
    The <em>Club Leadership Handbook</em> says officers set the tone for a positive environment. Greet every member and guest by name. In my club, we started a "Welcome Buddy" system, pairing new members with mentors. One shy member, Lisa, stayed because her buddy checked in weekly. Result? She's now our VP Education. A 2024 study showed clubs with strong onboarding retain 20% more members.</p>
    
    <p>2. <strong>Celebrate Small Wins</strong><br>
    Recognize achievements, from first speeches to Pathways levels. Last year, we gave out "Star of the Meeting" stickers for small contributions, like great Table Topics. Our retention rate jumped 15%. As officers, plan monthly recognitions—use <em>Club Central</em> to track awards.</p>
    
    <p>3. <strong>Listen and Adapt</strong><br>
    Ask members what they want. We held a "Dream Club" survey and learned members craved more leadership roles. We added a "Guest Host" role, and engagement soared. Use surveys or casual chats to keep your finger on the pulse.</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion and Call to Action</h3>
    <p>You're not just officers—you're retention heroes. Create a welcoming culture, celebrate wins, and listen to your members. Your challenge: This month, implement one retention strategy. Host a welcome event, give out an award, or run a survey. Your club's future depends on you—make it shine!</p>
    
    <h3>Activity: Retention Spotlight</h3>
    <p>Role-play as a VPPR welcoming a new member at the front of the room. Example: Highlight their first speech on social media. Audience suggests improvements.</p>
