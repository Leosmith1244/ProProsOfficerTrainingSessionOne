    <h3>Welcome Speech</h3>
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
    Imagine a Toastmasters club where guests flock to every meeting, inspired by a vibrant online presence and a clear brand. That's the power of a great VPPR. As District Director, I've seen clubs like yours in District 106 skyrocket from a few guests to President's Distinguished, thanks to stellar PR. Welcome to our Club Officer Training for July 17, 2025!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
    Today, we'll equip you, especially our VPPRs, with tools to lead with confidence, align your team, and build a magnetic club identity. I'll outline our objectives and how this training helps your club earn DCP credit.</p>
    
    <h4>Supporting Points</h4>
    <p>1. <strong>Why VPPRs Are Game-Changers</strong><br>
    The <em>Club Leadership Handbook</em> calls VPPRs the voice of the club. Your social media posts, flyers, and events bring in guests. Last year, a VPPR's X campaign brought 10 new members to a struggling club. You'll learn how to do this today.</p>
    
    <p>2. <strong>Training Objectives</strong><br>
    We'll dive into retention, share PR success stories, and focus on VPPR strategies to boost your club's brand. You'll leave with a plan to make your club the talk of the town.</p>
    
    <p>3. <strong>Earning DCP Credit</strong><br>
    Attend at least 2 hours of training, including one peer session, to earn DCP credit. Today's 90-minute session, plus an elective in July or August, gets you there. Use <em>Club Central</em> to track progress.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Conclusion and Call to Action</strong><br>
    VPPRs, you're the megaphone for your club's success. Dive into today's sessions, especially our VPPR breakout, and connect with peers. Grab your <em>Club Leadership Handbook</em> and let's make your club shine!</p>
